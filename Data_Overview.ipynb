San Francisco neighborhoods : i will using Geojson file that provided by DataSF (https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/6ia5-2f8k/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD), and then scrape it to gain their San Francisco's neighborhood name, But this data lacks the coordinates too, I will obtain them using geopy library\n\n2. Toronto neighborhoods: I will scrape the following Wikipedia page, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M, using the BeautifulSoup package to obtain and transform the data in the table of postal codes on the page and transform it into a pandas dataframe.\nBut this data lacks the coordinates too, I will obtain them from a link to a csv file that has the geographical coordinates of each postal code in Toronto: http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data.\nLater I will concatenate two dataset using methods provided in pandas library.\n\n3. New York neighborhoods: I will convert addresses, retrieved from IBM server, https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/fbpwbovar7lf8p5sgddm06cgipa2rxpe.json (so you can simply run a wget command and access the data), into their equivalent latitude and longitude values.\n \nAlso, I will use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in the cities. I will use the explore endpoint to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters.\nI will use the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task. Finally, you will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in given three cities and their emerging clusters.\n4. Foursquare: I will refer to www.foursquare.com for data about venues in neighborhoods.\n",
